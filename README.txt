Produce a collection of functions that insulate a program from the inefficiencies of I/O-related system calls using the method discussed in class.
Create functions analogous to the system calls open(2), close(2), read(2), write(2), and lseek(2).
You will also implement a function to flush a buffer: that is, to force all buffered data to be delivered to its destination 
(note that this only makes sense in the context of writing).
