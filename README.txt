AUTHORS:
- Sammy Van Cleve

THINGS TO DO:
- need to fix my read functionality when doing read and write
together; run strace on the code with fread and fwrite to see
how that's working
- need to write myseek using lseek
- clean up the code and the comments - there's a lot of random
bs in the comments right now

KNOWN BUGS:
- myread has some sort of error because special characters show up when reading; need to figure that out
